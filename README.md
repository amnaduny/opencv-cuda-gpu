Easy installation OpenCV Python and CUDA GPU

In my case, I have installed Python 3.9.12

Follow this step carefully (this step installation is only for windows, I'm not linux user so I don't know how to install it on linux) :
1. install Cmake, you can download [here](https://cmake.org/download/) and choose windows x64 installer or you can just click [here](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.26.3/cmake-3.26.3-windows-x86_64.msi) to download Cmake installation
2. download opencv 4.6.0
