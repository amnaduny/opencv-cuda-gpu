In my case, I have installed Python 3.9.12

Follow this step carefully (this step installation is for windows) :
1. install Cmake, you can download [here](https://cmake.org/download/) and choose windows x64 installer or you can just click [here](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.26.3/cmake-3.26.3-windows-x86_64.msi) to download Cmake installation directly.
2. download and extract opencv 4.6.0 source code [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/refs/tags/4.6.0.zip) or you can try to download other version shown below.
![opencv version](https://github.com/amnaduny/opencv-cuda-gpu/assets/117987126/d2021d3e-c49b-4b9d-ab62-802b508b499b)
3. download and extract opencv_contrib 4.6.0 [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/archive/refs/tags/4.6.0.zip), remember to download the same version in opencv source code and contrib file.
4. create folder "opencvGPU" in your local computer, in my case I create it on local disk C:\opencvGPU. put opencv-4.6.0 and opencv_contrib-4.6.0 in this folder and create 'build' folder. we have empty 'build' folder, this folder will be a place for cmake to build the binaries. do the same as picture below.
![cmake dir](https://github.com/amnaduny/opencv-cuda-gpu/assets/117987126/0ecd0a13-df68-4716-9fb9-e26ac0fdcf20)
