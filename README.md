Easy installation OpenCV Python and CUDA GPU

In my case, I have installed Python 3.9.12

Follow this step carefully (this step installation is only for windows, I'm not linux user so I don't know how to install it on linux) :
1. install Cmake, you can download [here](https://cmake.org/download/) and choose windows x64 installer or you can just click [here](https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.26.3/cmake-3.26.3-windows-x86_64.msi) to download Cmake installation.
2. download opencv 4.6.0 [here](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/refs/heads/4.x.zip) or you can try to download other version depend on your computer specification.
![opencv version](https://github.com/amnaduny/opencv-cuda-gpu/assets/117987126/d2021d3e-c49b-4b9d-ab62-802b508b499b)
